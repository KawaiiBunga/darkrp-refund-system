# darkrp-refund-system
Just a super simple darkrp addon that refunds players entities when the server crashes. 

Has respawn option coded but not in the config/lang/derma menu. 

The fund menu should pop up automatically upon server crash/reconnect, but if it doesn't, try !refund in chat

NO SUPPORT WILL BE GIVEN FOR THIS ADDON AND IT'S STATE IS "AS IS"
