# darkrp-refund-system
Just a super simple darkrp addon that refunds players entities when the server crashes. 

Basically snippets from other addons with a little custom derma menu work. Has respawn option coded but not in the config/lang/derma menu. 

NO SUPPORT WILL BE GIVEN FOR THIS ADDON AND IT'S STATE IS "AS IS"
